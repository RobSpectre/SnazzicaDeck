      .title.text-outline Snazzisms
      p.copy.text-white
       | I was trying to keep my heart in my chest when you came around the
       | table to sit next to me at the Brandy Library. Your beauty was so
       | striking, your positivity was so evident, your confidence was so
       | alluring, it was all I could do to keep my jaw from hitting the floor.
       | But in addition to all those attractive features, I was mostly struck
       | by the originality of your language.
      p.copy.text-white
       | I've come to call them "Snazzisms" - turns of phrase that are uniquely
       | you. Places are now "realms," dents are "boops" and "ouchies," and of
       | course my favorite - the squanchly utilitarian "schmerr."
      p.copy.text-white
       | Your combination of Internet culture with an effervescent bubbly vibe
       | made for such a striking impression.
      p.copy.text-white
       | After we parted company, you nodded after the hug and hopped off to
       | try to catch the ferry. "This lady rules," I thought to myself as I
       | made it around the Ghostbusters firehouse to head home.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/capacious_handpurse.png' background='eae1e0')
      .title.text-outline Ready to Go
      p.copy.text-black
       | Wherever it is we are and we encounter an unpredicted need. A pen,
       | some tissue, some sun lotion, somehow you always have it. That bulging
       | black hand purse the size of a mini football feels like such a
       | Jessica thing.
      p.copy.text-black
       | It feels like you're always ready to go. You have a rare capacity for
       | adventure that I feel is best personified by that bag. It is like your
       | little go-bag you never leave behind.
      p.copy.text-black
       | When an adventure presents itself, it feels like you always are
       | prepared to pursue it.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/putterpoop.png' background='fde16b')
      .title.text-outline Grit
      p.copy.text-black
       | I think it was somewhere around stroke 40 at the end of our round at
       | punk rock minigolf that I said to myself, "I don't imagine Jessica
       | Augier gives up on anything."
      p.copy.text-black
       | Despite multiple failures and interruptions from some spectacularly
       | misbehaved children, you kept swinging. Especially in what I do for a
       | living, failure is so persistent and frequent, that quit or grit
       | impulse is such an important thing for me in a sweetheart.
      p.copy.text-black
       | If she isn't going to give up on a silly toilet putt putt obstacle, I
       | thought, she's going to be someone I want to stand with for a long
       | time.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/popcorn.png' background='da3789')
      .title.text-outline Her Taste
      p.copy.text-white
       | "What do you link about her?" Vanessa asked.
      p.copy.text-white
       | She was rooting for you early on in pure identity terms ("how is it
       | going with the witchy girl" was a common question during this time),
       | but we were having the first real face-to-face talk about you.
      p.copy.text-white
       | So many things came to mind, but I finally settled on "her taste."
      p.copy.text-white
       | Your aesthetic compelled an immediate attraction from when we first
       | met. That taste becomes ever more magnetic the more I learn about it.
       | Every new band you introduce, every new show you share, every new
       | social circle you describe. All the metal, all the punk, all the
       | psychobilly, all the Coney, all the films, all the comedy - the more
       | you share, the more I want.
      p.copy.text-white
       | Rob Sheffield once wrote that "mix tapes are love letters set to
       | music." Feeling your love for all the moving art in the world in so
       | many different forms makes me feel like the universe of what I will
       | love expanded threefold.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/steam_roller_card.png')
      .title.text-outline Rolled 
      p.copy.text-white
       | "That might have been a little too much Rob."
      p.copy.text-white
       | I'm not sure if it was our very first night together, but it certainly
       | was close. You just got the first steamroller and I was concerned if I
       | had revealed the depths of my goofiness a little too early.
      p.copy.text-white
       | But it - impossibly, inconceivably - still managed to land. That it
       | you made it a running gag with the Lego set makes me smile every time
       | I see it when I sit down for dinner.
      p.copy.text-white
       | After that, I just felt so comfortable. My sense of humor isn't
       | received with universal favor. I have had sweethearts who were
       | genuinely funny and kind of heart, but were too self-serious for a lot
       | of my base comedic impulses.
      p.copy.text-white
       | I feel like I got to be my genuine self with you from a very early
       | stage. I'm sorry that it sometimes manifests itself with you getting
       | squished.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/visor.png' background='305c75')
      .title.text-outline E-Town
      p.copy.text-white
       | "Welp," I said to myself, watching the air temperature gauge on the
       | Merc pass 110Â°F. "This is either going to work or it isn't."
      p.copy.text-white
       | Our first adventure out-of-town to go see Taylor compete in Formula
       | Drift gave me a little apprehension. It was still early in seeing each
       | other. I wasn't yet sure how you were feeling about the whole
       | motorsport thing. But above all it was going to be unbearably hot.
      p.copy.text-white
       | New York women are my favorite women in the world, but they do not
       | have a reputation for managing discomfort super well. Knowing how
       | oppressive a racetrack can be in these conditions, I was preparing
       | myself mentally for an early departure.
      p.copy.text-white
       | That anxiety feels so silly now. From E-Town to Turkey to punk rock
       | minigolf - you're just so *down*. You are so committed to finding the
       | fun in everything. Your companionship is so powerful and something
       | that fills me with profound gratitude.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/snoozica.png' background='232323')
      .title.text-outline Snooze Abuse
      p.copy.text-white
       | When we are in bed, I never want to leave.
      p.copy.text-white
       | Full stop.
      p.copy.text-white
       | When I heard that default iPhone alarm in the morning, I always purse
       | my lips into a wry smile as I know what is going to happen next.
       | You're going to hit the snooze and I'm going to get another guaranteed
       | fifteen minutes in bed with you.
      p.copy.text-white
       | The time we've shared this year in so many different contexts were to
       | the minute the most fun, the most funny and the most enjoyable I've
       | had. And it has been quite a year on those three fronts.
      p.copy.text-white
       | But the time I enjoyed the most - the time I think about literally all
       | the time! - was in that room and in that bed. With you.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/ada.png' background='084182')
      .title.text-outline The Meeting
      p.copy.text-white
       | The thing about Ada is she gets along with everybody. Even Bassem, who
       | famously hates dogs, couldn't stand a chance to the power of her
       | unconditional love given so freely. As a result of the many vectors
       | of compatibility generating concern in a new relationship, whether or
       | not my dog was going to like you was not among them.
      p.copy.text-white
       | But when I saw your tears as you leaned down to meet Ada for the first
       | time I was initially a bit taken aback. "Is this a genuine
       | love-at-first-sight thing? Did she just fall for Ada?"
      p.copy.text-white
       | Everyone loves Ada eventually. But until now there was only one that
       | loved her instantly - me. I've shared my gratitude for how well you
       | care for Ada before and how singular my confidence is when she is in
       | your exclusive care.
      p.copy.text-white
       | What I don't think I shared with you is how grateful I am for how well
       | you *love* her. When I am laying in bed or on the couch with the both
       | of you, I feel like the wealthiest man that ever lived. The abundance
       | of that love is so large it defies containment.
      p.copy.text-white
       | It feels like the thing I want to build most in this world.
    PokemonCard(src='/images/two_of_cups.png' background='393738')
      .title.text-outline First Kiss
      p.copy.text-white
       | I was trying to appear like the message was being received and allay
       | your concern, but I couldn't help but snort and chortle a bit as you
       | started backpedaling after the tarot reading.
      p.copy.text-white
       | It was my first so I had dim comprehension of what was going on other
       | than by the speed of your babbling, it was something that was
       | significant to you. As the tempo of your walk back increased and your
       | ability to maintain eye contact decreased, I thought to myself, "This
       | gal thinks this might be real."
      p.copy.text-white
       | The direct object I was addressing with that thought wasn't tarot - it
       | was how we felt about each other. It was clear you were not ready for
       | this big. While I think I was in more of an open mindset, I wasn't
       | either. But I could feel something real before the cards came out.
      p.copy.text-white
       | After they were on the table, I had to giggle at how you reacted. It
       | didn't seem to me that you would be so quick to set expectations
       | unless you felt it too.
      p.copy.text-white
       | A few moments later we would kiss. I knew then how we feel about each
       | other carries an inevitability. I wasn't sure how long it would take,
       | but I was certain from then where we would end up.
